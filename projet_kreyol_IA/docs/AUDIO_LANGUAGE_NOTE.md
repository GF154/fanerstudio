# üîä Audio Language Note

## Issue: Haitian Creole Audio

### **Problem:**
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) **does not support Haitian Creole (`ht`)** directly.

### **Solution Applied:**
The application automatically uses **French (`fr`)** for audio generation when the target language is Haitian Creole.

### **Why French?**
- French is one of Haiti's official languages
- French pronunciation is close to Haitian Creole
- Most Haitians understand French
- gTTS French voice quality is excellent

### **What This Means:**
- ‚úÖ **Translation:** Still in Haitian Creole (perfect!)
- ‚úÖ **Text Output:** Still in Haitian Creole (perfect!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Audio:** Uses French pronunciation (best available option)

### **How It Works:**
When you request audio for Haitian Creole text:
1. Text is translated to Haitian Creole ‚úÖ
2. Audio generation detects language is `ht`
3. Automatically switches to `fr` (French) for TTS
4. You get Creole text with French-accented audio

### **Example:**
```
Input:  "Hello, how are you?"
Text:   "Bonjou, kijan ou ye?" (Haitian Creole)
Audio:  Pronounced with French accent
```

### **Alternative Solutions:**

#### **Option 1: Use French Throughout (Current)**
- ‚úÖ Best quality
- ‚úÖ Widely understood
- ‚úÖ No additional setup

#### **Option 2: Use Alternative TTS (Future)**
Install additional TTS engines that might support Creole:
```powershell
pip install pyttsx3  # Offline TTS
pip install TTS      # Coqui TTS (more voices)
```

#### **Option 3: Record Your Own Voice**
- Record Creole audio manually
- Replace generated audio files
- Most authentic but time-consuming

### **Languages Supported by gTTS:**

| Language | Code | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| English | en | ‚úÖ Native |
| French | fr | ‚úÖ Native |
| Spanish | es | ‚úÖ Native |
| Portuguese | pt | ‚úÖ Native |
| Haitian Creole | ht | ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses French |

### **Recommendation:**

For now, **use the French audio** with Creole text. This provides:
- High-quality audio
- Understandable pronunciation
- No additional setup required

### **Future Improvements:**

We're looking into:
1. Alternative TTS engines
2. Custom Creole voice models
3. Community-contributed recordings

### **Your Current Settings:**

The fix has been applied automatically:
- Translation: Haitian Creole ‚úÖ
- Text output: Haitian Creole ‚úÖ
- Audio: French (for compatibility)

### **To Use:**

Just continue using the app as normal. The audio will be generated in French, but your translated text remains in perfect Haitian Creole!

**Note:** This is a limitation of Google's TTS service, not your installation. The translation quality to Haitian Creole remains excellent!
