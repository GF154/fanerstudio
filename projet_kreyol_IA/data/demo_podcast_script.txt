Guest: Mèsi pou envitasyon an! Thank you for having me today.

Host: Today we're discussing the importance of preserving the Haitian Creole language. Can you tell us why this matters?

Guest: Well, Kreyòl is more than just a language - it's the heart of Haitian identity. When we speak Kreyòl, we connect with our ancestors and our culture.

Host: That's beautifully said. And technology can help preserve it, right?

Guest: Absolutely! Tools like this podcast creator make it easier to create content in Kreyòl. More content means more people engaging with the language.

Host: What would you say to someone who wants to learn Kreyòl?
