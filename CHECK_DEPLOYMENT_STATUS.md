```
⏳ Render might still be building
⏳ First deploy takes 10-15 minutes sometimes
⏳ Not 7 minutes!
```

### **2. Service Name Changed**
```
Expected: faner-studio-complete
Actual: ???
```

### **3. Build Failed**
```
❌ Dependencies error
❌ Python version error
❌ Start command error
```

## 🎯 **CHECK THESE NOW:**

### **Go to Render Dashboard:**
```

```

### **Find your new service and check:**

#### **A. Status:**
- ✅ "Live" (green) = Good, wait longer
- 🔄 "Deploying" (blue) = Still building
- ❌ "Build failed" (red) = ERROR

#### **B. Service Name:**
```
Is it called: faner-studio-complete?
Or something else?
```

#### **C. Logs Tab:**
```
Look for:
- RED errors
- "Build failed"

```
